BuddyLingua is the project I created in ten days within a team of four as a student of Le Wagon coding bootcamp (Fullstack Web Development Program, Oslo).

The main idea behind this app was to help young people learn foreign languages in more organic and natural way, as well as make new friends online.

BuddyLingua has the following built-in features: log in, sign out, chat, search with various filtering options, add/delete buddy and edit profile info.

During the project phase I took the role of the Creative Lead. I was responsible for designing the website’s visual identity, creating prototypes in Figma and setting the Front-end production environment. I also created the data base seeds, the majority of Sass components, as well as assisted my colleagues in designing and implementing various website features.

After the bootcamp I continued working on the project – I improved the visual look, animated the content with Sass and JavaScript, made the website responsive on all devices and deployed it on the Heroku platform.
